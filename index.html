<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>Some of the more major known issues are marked like this. There are many other issues that have been raised as well; the issues given in this document are not the only known issues! There are also some spec-wide issues that have not yet been addressed: case-sensitivity is a very poorly handled topic right now, and the firing of events needs to be unified (right now some bubble, some don't, they all use different text to fire events, etc). It would also be nice to unify the rules on downloading content when attributes change (e.g. src attributes) - should they initiate downloads when the element immediately, is inserted in the document, when active scripts end, etc. This matters e.g. if an attribute is set twice in a row (does it hit the network twice).</p>
